# Hyper UI

A chakra-ui like library for gui frameworks. Right now supports yew and dioxus.

## Yew

Yew is a great renderer. The examples/ only work for dioxus right now. Check out hyper-ui-examples repo for multiple bin targets that use hyper ui and yew.

## Dioxus

Links dioxus core and builds ontop of rsx to create zero-overhead abstractions.

HyperUI adds extra macros to dioxus:

```rust
#[derive(Component)]

```
